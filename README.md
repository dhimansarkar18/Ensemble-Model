# Background

This Census Data Ensemble Classification Model analyses the census dataset and predicts the income of an individual on different feature variables to greater than or less than $50,000(USD). 

**Models utilized in our analysis:**

 - Random Forest
 - AdaBoosting
 - Gradient Boosting
 - XG Boosting

# Dataset

The data set can be downloaded via github: 
("https://github.com/dhimansarkar18/Ensemble-Model/blob/main/census_data.csv")

# Code

Python Notebook: 
("https://github.com/dhimansarkar18/Ensemble-Model/blob/main/Ensemble_Model_Dhiman_Sarkar.ipynb")

# Instructions on How to Launch
 - I. Open the python notebook on google colab. 
 - II. Mount the Google Drive: drive.mount("/content/drive") 
 - III. Link the working directories: census = "/content/drive/MyDrive/MSBA_Colab_2020/ML_Algorithms/CA04/Data/census_data.csv"
 - IV. Run the Code 
 - V. Compare Performance Across the Four Models
							
# Procedures
